<h3 align="center">Python-based Blockchain implementation</h3>

*This Python-based blockchain implementation demonstrates core principles like block hashing and chain validation while featuring advanced functionalities such as smart contracts, transaction validation, and decentralized networking. It simulates real-world blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum for learning and exploration.*

# TO-DO
## Verify Transactions
 - Validate the digital signature using the sender's public key.
 - Ensure the transaction follows protocol rules (e.g., no double-spending).
 - Cross-check against the blockchain's consensus mechanism (e.g., proof-of-work).
 ## Implement the user.py functionality
 - Add the user variables into the transaction methods
 - After that adjust its usage in the transactions instead of strings and integers.
 - Test its implementation by running main.py
