<h3 align="center">Python-based Blockchain implementation</h3>
This Python-based blockchain implementation demonstrates core principles like block hashing and chain validation while featuring advanced functionalities such as smart contracts, transaction validation, and decentralized networking. It simulates real-world blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum for learning and exploration.

**TODO:**

- Just worked on getting dummy main.py so we can view stdout mine_block seems to run an infinite loops, this could be from two issues:
    1. Incorrect calculation of hash
    2. Issue with calculation of difficulty
        (COULD BE BOTH?)
