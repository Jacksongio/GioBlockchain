<h1 align="center">WELCOME TO GIOBLOCKCHAIN</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Computer Science student at Virginia Tech.</h3>
This Python-based blockchain implementation demonstrates core principles like block hashing and chain validation while featuring advanced functionalities such as smart contracts, transaction validation, and decentralized networking. It simulates real-world blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum for learning and exploration.


TODO:

Just worked on getting dummy main.py so we can view stdout
mine_block seems to run an infinite loops, this could be from two issues:
    -Incorrect calculation of hash
    -Issue with calculation of difficulty
        (COULD BE BOTH?)
